# depl-keyboard-layout

Shipping a customized keyboard layout for Windows OS as binary installation package in the releases.
The keyboard layout has been designed to match an alternative keyboard layoung available in Ubuntu Gnome:

- Polish (Germany, no dead keys)

I used Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (MSKLC) to define this layout for MS Windows.

The layout enables simultanous typing in German and Polish by providing default shortcuts to access special characters from Polish alphabet (e.g. the ogonek characters), while preserving the German QWERTZ keyboard layout.

Furthermore, I include two self-made fonts based on my personal handwriting style.
